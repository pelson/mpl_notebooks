#Format for Example Notebooks
##General
Place the title of the example (not including the section) at the top of the notebook in a Heading 1 cell. 
For example, if the full title of the example is `images_contours_and_fields example code: image_demo.py`, then write the title as `Image Demo` and also title the notebook the same but with underscores, which would be `Image_Demo` in this case.

##Code
Place the code from the original example into code cells in notebook, separate the cells where it is needed and/or make sense in the context of the example.

##Metadata

```
